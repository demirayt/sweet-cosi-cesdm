- EnergyConversionTechnology
description: A Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Plant is an energy conversion facility that simultaneously produces useful electrical
  energy and useful thermal energy from a single fuel input by recovering heat that would otherwise be wasted in conventional
  electricity-only generation. It performs cogeneration through coupled thermodynamic processes, typically enhancing overall
  fuel utilization efficiency relative to separate heat and electricity production.
attributes:
- id: input_origin
  description: Classifies whether the input energy carrier is exogenous (primary resource originating outside the modeled
    energy network, e.g. solar irradiance, wind, hydro inflow, crude oil imports) or endogenous (delivered from an internal
    energy node such as electricity, gas, hydrogen).
  value:
    type: string
    constraints:
        enum:
        - endogenous
        - exogenous
  required: true
  provenance_ref: Define the provenance here.
- id: net_electrical_efficiency
  description: Net electrical efficiency is the ratio of the net electrical energy output of the CHP plant to the total fuel
    energy input under defined operating conditions. It quantifies the plant’s effectiveness in converting input fuel energy
    into electricity.

- id: co2_price
  comment: CO2 Price is a monetary value assigned to each tonne of carbon dioxide (or CO₂-equivalent) emitted within an energy
    system. It represents the cost of emitting greenhouse gases and is used to internalize the environmental and societal
    damages associated with climate change.
