name: TransmissionLine
description: A transmission line (or distribution line) is a physical electrical conductor system used to transfer power between
  two network nodes. It is characterized by its electrical parameters (impedance, admittance), thermal limits, topology, and
  physical construction such as length or number of parallel circuits. Transmission lines can represent overhead lines or
  underground cables and are key components in AC load-flow, dynamic simulations, and energy system studies.
attributes:
- id: line_length
  description: The physical length of the transmission line, expressed in kilometers (km). Length may be used to scale per-unit-length
    electrical parameters or compute line losses and charging currents.

  provenance_ref: Define the provenance here.
- id: parallel_circuit_count
  description: The number of identical transmission circuits run in parallel between the same endpoints. Parallel circuits
    increase overall capacity, reduce effective impedance, and provide redundancy in grid operation.

    type: integer
  required: false
  label: Parallel Circuit Count

- id: series_reactance
  description: The imaginary component of the line’s series impedance, expressed in ohms (Ω). It primarily represents the
    inductive characteristics of the line and strongly influences power flow, voltage stability, and short-circuit behavior.

  provenance_ref: Define the provenance here.
- id: series_resistance
  description: The real component of the line’s series impedance, expressed in ohms. It represents the resistive losses in
    the conductors, leading to I^2R power losses and voltage drop along the line.
  value:
    type: decimal
    constraints:
      minimum: 0.0
  required: false

  provenance_ref: Define the provenance here.
- id: shunt_susceptance
  description: Imaginary component of shunt admittance (microS/km). It models the capacitive coupling of overhead conductors
    or cables to ground and affects reactive power flow, especially in long lines.

      minimum: 0.0

  provenance_ref: Define the provenance here.
- id: thermal_capacity_rating
  description: The maximum continuous apparent power flow limit of the line based on its thermal current-carrying capability,
    expressed in MVA. Exceeding this limit risks conductor overheating, sag violations, or insulation degradation.
