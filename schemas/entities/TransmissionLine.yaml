name: TransmissionLine
description: A transmission line (or distribution line) is a physical electrical conductor
  system used to transfer power between two network nodes. It is characterized by
  its electrical parameters (impedance, admittance), thermal limits, topology, and
  physical construction such as length or number of parallel circuits. Transmission
  lines can represent overhead lines or underground cables and are key components
  in AC load-flow, dynamic simulations, and energy system studies.
