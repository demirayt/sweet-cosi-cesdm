name: EnergyDemand
description: A consumer load represents the demand for an energy carrier (typically
  electricity, heat, hydrogen, or gas) over time in an energy system. A load may be
  static, time-varying, or flexible. It can be connected to operational constraints
  (flexibility windows, demand shifting), cost signals, and reliability metrics such
  as the value of lost load (VOLL).
