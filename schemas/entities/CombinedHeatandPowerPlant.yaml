description: A Combined Heat and Power (CHP) Plant is an energy conversion facility
  that simultaneously produces useful electrical energy and useful thermal energy
  from a single fuel input by recovering heat that would otherwise be wasted in conventional
  electricity-only generation. It performs cogeneration through coupled thermodynamic
  processes, typically enhancing overall fuel utilization efficiency relative to separate
  heat and electricity production.
