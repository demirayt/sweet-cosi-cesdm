name: NetTransferCapacity
description: Net Transfer Capacity (NTC) is the maximum allowable power flow between
  two interconnected areas, regions, or control zones in an electrical transmission
  network under predefined operating conditions. It represents the transfer limit
  used for cross-border trading, congestion management, and operational planning.
  NTC accounts for network constraints, security margins, and system reliability,
  ensuring that the transfer does not violate voltage, thermal, or stability limits.
