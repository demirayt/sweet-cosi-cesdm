attributes:
  input_origin:
    description: Classifies whether the input energy carrier is exogenous (primary
      resource originating outside the modeled energy network, e.g. solar irradiance,
      wind, hydro inflow, crude oil imports) or endogenous (delivered from an internal
      energy node such as electricity, gas, hydrogen).
    provenance_ref: Define the provenance here.
    constraints:
    - endogenous
    - exogenous
    value:
      type: string
      default: exogenous
      constraints:
        enum:
        - endogenous
        - exogenous
  co2_emission_intensity:
    description: The amount of CO₂ emissions associated with producing or delivering
      one MWh of the energy carrier, expressed in tons CO₂/MWh. Used for carbon accounting
      and environmental impact modeling.
    label: CO2 Emission Intensity
    provenance_ref: Define the provenance here.
    value:
      type: decimal
      default: 0.0
      constraints:
        minimum: 0.0
    unit:
      constraints:
        enum:
        - tCO2/MWh
  energy_carrier_group:
    description: High-level group of the carrier, such as "electricity", "heat", "gas",
      or "hydrogen". Useful for aggregation and reporting.
    provenance_ref: Define the provenance here.
    value:
      type: string
  energy_carrier_type:
    description: Description of the energy carrier type.
    label: Energy Carrier Type
    provenance_ref: Define the provenance here.
    value:
      type: string
  is_primary_fuel:
    description: Flag indicating whether this carrier is considered a primary fuel
      (e.g., natural gas) as opposed to a secondary or derived carrier.
    constraints:
    - 'true'
    - 'false'
    provenance_ref: Define the provenance here.
    value:
      type: string
  is_secondary_fuel:
    description: Flag indicating whether this carrier is considered a secondary or
      derived fuel (e.g., hydrogen produced via electrolysis).
    constraints:
    - 'true'
    - 'false'
    provenance_ref: Define the provenance here.
    value:
      type: string
