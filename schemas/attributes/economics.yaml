  co2_price:
    comment: CO2 Price is a monetary value assigned to each tonne of carbon dioxide
      (or CO₂-equivalent) emitted within an energy system. It represents the cost
      of emitting greenhouse gases and is used to internalize the environmental and
      societal damages associated with climate change.
