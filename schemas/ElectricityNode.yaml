name: ElectricityNode
parents:
- EnergyNode
description: A Electricity Node is a distinct point within an electrical power system where electrical quantities such as voltage,
  current, power, and frequency are defined and measured. Grid Nodes can represent physical entities such as substations,
  buses, or terminals of electrical equipment, or logical points in system studies and simulations.
attributes:
- id: nominal_voltage
  description: The standard or rated voltage level assigned to that node under normal operating conditions. It represents
    the voltage at which equipment connected to the node is designed to operate efficiently and safely. It is typically expressed
    in volts (V) or kilovolts (kV) and corresponds to the line-to-line or line-to-neutral voltage, depending on the system
    configuration.
