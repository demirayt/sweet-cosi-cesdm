name: EnergyCarrier
description: An energy carrier represents a medium through which energy is delivered, stored or consumed. This includes electricity,
  natural gas, hydrogen, heat, or any other energy form. Attributes define tager environmental and economic characteristics
  of the carrier, which are crucial for energy system modeling, dispatch, and lifecycle assessment.
attributes:
- id: co2_emission_intensity
  description: The amount of CO₂ emissions associated with producing or delivering one MWh of the energy carrier, expressed
    in tons CO₂/MWh. Used for carbon accounting and environmental impact modeling.
  value:
    type: decimal
    default: 0.0
    constraints:
      minimum: 0.0
  required: false
  label: CO2 Emission Intensity
  unit:
    constraints:
      enum:
      - tCO2/MWh
  provenance_ref: Define the provenance here.
- id: energy_carrier_cost
  description: The monetary cost of the energy carrier per unit of energy, expressed in MU/MWh. Includes production, delivery,
    and variable operational costs, used for economic dispatch and optimization.
  value:
    type: decimal
    default: 0.0
    constraints:
      minimum: 0.0
  required: false
  label: Energy Carrier Cost
  unit:

      enum:
      - MU/MWh
  provenance_ref: Define the provenance here.
- id: energy_carrier_group
  description: High-level group of the carrier, such as "electricity", "heat", "gas", or "hydrogen". Useful for aggregation
    and reporting.
  value:
    type: string
  required: false
  provenance_ref: Define the provenance here.
- id: energy_carrier_type
  description: Description of the energy carrier type.
  value:
    type: string
  required: false
  label: Energy Carrier Type
  provenance_ref: Define the provenance here.
- id: is_primary_fuel
  description: Flag indicating whether this carrier is considered a primary fuel (e.g., natural gas) as opposed to a secondary
    or derived carrier.
  value:
    type: string
  constraints:
  - 'true'
  - 'false'
  required: false
  provenance_ref: Define the provenance here.
- id: is_secondary_fuel
  description: Flag indicating whether this carrier is considered a secondary or derived fuel (e.g., hydrogen produced via
    electrolysis).
  value:
    type: string
  constraints:
  - 'true'
  - 'false'
  required: false
  provenance_ref: Define the provenance here.
- id: name
  description: Descriptive name.
