description: An energy converter represents a system or device that transforms energy from one form (input energy carrier)
  to another (output energy carrier). This can include generators, storage charging/discharging, or conversion devices such
  as electrolyzers or heat pumps. Attributes define the operational efficiency, capacity, and connectivity to the energy system.

- id: co2_price
  comment: CO2 Price is a monetary value assigned to each tonne of carbon dioxide (or CO₂-equivalent) emitted within an energy
    system. It represents the cost of emitting greenhouse gases and is used to internalize the environmental and societal
    damages associated with climate change.
