attributes:
- id: conversion_rules
  description: List of conversion relations between input and output ports. Each rule references an input port ID and an output
    port ID defined under ports-inputs / ports-outputs and specifies an efficiency (0..1).

- id: input_origin
  description: Classifies whether the input energy carrier is exogenous (primary resource originating outside the modeled
    energy network, e.g. solar irradiance, wind, hydro inflow, crude oil imports) or endogenous (delivered from an internal
    energy node such as electricity, gas, hydrogen).

- id: co2_price
  comment: CO2 Price is a monetary value assigned to each tonne of carbon dioxide (or CO₂-equivalent) emitted within an energy
    system. It represents the cost of emitting greenhouse gases and is used to internalize the environmental and societal
    damages associated with climate change.
