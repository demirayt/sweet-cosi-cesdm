# `example_explore_cesdm_model.py` — Step by Step

## Why this example matters

Building a model is half the story — this is the other half: querying
a model you didn't necessarily build yourself. Written for a
PyPSA-imported model specifically (capacity by country, generation
mix, storage, network summary), but every function in it is a
reusable pattern for exploring *any* CESDM model, built from nothing
but `model.entities` and plain attribute/relation lookups — no
energy-specific magic, just systematic traversal.

> This script's `main()` needs a PyPSA-imported YAML file as input
> (`--yaml path/to/model.yaml`, produced by
> [`example_import_pypsa.py`](README_PYPSA_IMPORT_LOGIC.md)) — the
> individual functions below are demonstrated here directly against a
> small, self-contained model instead, so they can be run with no
> external data at all.

## The simplest pattern: count entities by class

```python
def model_entity_counts(model: CesdmModel) -> Dict[str, int]:
    """model.entities is { class_name: { entity_id: entity_object } }."""
    return {cls: len(entities) for cls, entities in model.entities.items() if entities}
```

```python
from example_simple import build_simple_model
model = build_simple_model(Path("schemas"))
print(model_entity_counts(model))
```

```
{'CarrierDomain': 3, 'ConversionUnit': 1, 'DemandUnit': 2, 'GenerationUnit': 1,
 'HydroGenerationUnit': 1, 'Interconnector': 2, 'StorageUnit': 1, 'EnergyCarrier': 7,
 'ConversionPort': 3, 'ElectricalBus': 3, ...}
```

`model.entities` is the whole model — a dict keyed by class name, each
value a dict of entity id to entity object. Every exploration function
in this file starts from this same structure.

## Reading a nameplate attribute across every instance of a class

```python
def bus_voltage_distribution(model: CesdmModel) -> Dict[int, int]:
    """Count ElectricalBuses by nominal voltage level [kV]."""
    dist: Dict[int, int] = defaultdict(int)
    for _bus_id, bus_ent in (model.entities.get("ElectricalBus") or {}).items():
        kv = _af(bus_ent, "nominal_voltage")
        if kv is not None:
            dist[int(round(kv))] += 1
    return dict(sorted(dist.items()))
```

```python
print(bus_voltage_distribution(model))
# -> {220: 3}
```

`nominal_voltage` lives directly on `ElectricalBus` (a nameplate
property, not something that changes between modelling contexts) —
`_af()` (defined near the top of the file) is a small helper that
reads a numeric attribute value out of the raw entity dict, tolerant
of it being absent.

---

## The harder pattern: following relations across views

Several functions (`build_asset_to_node`, `build_dispatch_index`,
`generation_capacity_by_country_and_type`) follow relation chains
rather than reading one entity directly — e.g. from a
`GenerationUnit`, to its `SinglePort.TopologyView` (via
`representsAsset`), to the `atNode` it's connected to, to that node's
`GeographicalRegion` (via `locatedIn`). Each hop is a plain dict
lookup; the multi-hop indexes (`build_asset_to_node`,
`build_node_to_country`) exist so later functions don't repeat the
same three-hop walk for every single asset.

---

## Run it yourself

Against a real PyPSA-imported model:

```bash
pip install -e ".[pypsa]"
python examples/example_import_pypsa.py --nc-path <network.nc> --schema-dir schemas --output-dir output/pypsa_model
python examples/example_explore_cesdm_model.py --schemas schemas --yaml output/pypsa_model/model.yaml
```

Or call any function directly against a model you already have, as
shown above.
