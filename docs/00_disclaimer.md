## Demonstration Version of CESDM

This version of the **Common Energy System Domain Model (CESDM)** and its accompanying toolbox is provided **for demonstration and methodological purposes only**.

It is **not a final or normative version** of the CESDM.

---

## Project Context

The development of this CESDM prototype is carried out **within the framework of the SWEET‑CoSi project**  
(**SWEET – Co‑evolution of the Swiss Energy System and Society**).

- Project website: https://sweet-cosi.ch  
- Funding framework: SWEET (Swiss Energy Research for the Energy Transition)

Within SWEET‑CoSi, CESDM is being developed as part of **Task 1.9**, which focuses on:
- conceptual and methodological foundations for **common energy system representations**
- shared domain models to support **interoperability across tools and research tasks**

The CESDM toolbox presented here serves as a **methodology demonstrator** for this task.

---

## Purpose of this Release

The primary goal of this version is to:

- Demonstrate the **schema-driven modelling methodology**
- Illustrate the **core concepts** of entities, attributes, and relations
- Showcase the **functionalities of the CESDM toolbox**
- Help users understand **how a Common Energy System Domain Model can be constructed and used in practice**
- Provide hands-on examples for learning, experimentation, and discussion

This release is intentionally **simplified and pragmatic** to lower the barrier for understanding the approach.

---

## Ontology Status

⚠️ **Important**

The schemas included in this version:

- Are **provisional**
- Are **not yet based on a finalized Common Energy System Domain Ontology**
- May change significantly in structure, naming, constraints, and semantics

A future version of CESDM will be:

- Explicitly grounded in a **formal Common Energy System Domain Ontology**
- More strictly aligned with semantic web / ontology best practices
- More stable and suitable for long-term interoperability

---

## What This Version Is — and Is Not

### This version **is**:
- A **methodological prototype**
- A **learning and exploration tool**
- A way to get a **feel for the modelling workflow**
- A basis for **feedback, iteration, and refinement** within SWEET‑CoSi

### This version **is not**:
- A finalized model or finalized tool
- A guaranteed stable API
- A complete or authoritative energy system ontology
- Optimized for production-scale modelling

---

## Intended Audience

This CESDM version is intended for:

- Researchers exploring **schema-driven energy system modelling**
- Developers interested in **model interoperability** and data integration
- Users who want to structure systems based on **domain models**
- Contributors interested in shaping a future CESDM ontology and schema ecosystem

---

## Looking Ahead

Future iterations of CESDM will focus on:

- Alignment with a **Common Energy System Domain Ontology**
- Energy domain knowledge expansion and refinement
- Standardization of terminology and relations
- Stronger validation guarantees
- Backward-compatibility strategies
- Tooling around ontology-driven model exchange

Feedback and experimentation with this version are **strongly encouraged** and will directly inform future releases within the SWEET‑CoSi project.

---

**In short:**  
This CESDM release is a **methodology demonstrator developed within SWEET‑CoSi (Task 1.9)** — not the final destination.
